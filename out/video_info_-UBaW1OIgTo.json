Tasked with designing 400 years into the future, 2 Arcadians set out with the mission. to both warn humanity of the dangers of the current climate conditions and show. our species its great potential should we\u00a0\nwork together, and so we begin known to the\u00a0\u00a0. arcadians as the Reckoning in the year 2040\u00a0\nwhere society's efforts to push initiatives\u00a0\u00a0. and agendas of sustainability failed due to\u00a0\nHumanity's obsession with over consumerism. Next we have, the dystopian era, in the year 2070, where the living conditions are. inconceivably depressing, unhygienic and inhumane. Also with the sheer mismanagement of waste dumping. around our beloved planet in space, leading world governments to assemble the people of the nations. . after much trial and tribulation we move on to\u00a0\nthe year 2100 The Retreat devised as a plan for\u00a0\u00a0. the rest & recovery of our natural world in\u00a0\nthe year 2100 Humanity looks to live away from\u00a0\u00a0. the surface for 50 years. And so a new chapter\u00a0\nbegins. with the return the year 2200. And upon\u00a0\u00a0. returning to the surface, Humanity finds that\u00a0\nthe plan to allow nature to once again flourish\u00a0\u00a0. worked outstandingly with all the greatest\u00a0\nscientists, pioneers, futurists and imagineers\u00a0\u00a0. devising methods of revolving the current\u00a0\nsociety's technology and architecture around trans-botanism. and with efforts of prosperity Humanity\u00a0\nbegins rebuilding with nature in the year 2250.. the imaginators and Visionaries of today in 2250\u00a0\nuse biomimetic 4D printing in order to grow. architecture, all from natural matter artificially\u00a0\nreproduced and edited for our needs and once again\u00a0\u00a0. assemble a harmonious routine life into local\u00a0\nneighborhoods. And just when our technological\u00a0\u00a0. development peaked as we thought, in comes the New\u00a0\nFrontier of what we consider to be the nature of\u00a0\u00a0. life itself we've finally done it. The singularity\u00a0\nis here. Humans have merged with AI and uploaded\u00a0\u00a0. themselves to the digital realm leaving behind all\u00a0\nmanners of physicality therefore solidifying our\u00a0\u00a0. position as a type one civilization with\u00a0\nour eyes fixated on the next challenge\u00a0\u00a0. brought to you by Arcadia foundry's\u00a0\ndesign team.
