Going in a little can\nthrough deep space.. It\u2019s a very harsh\nenvironment.. We think you can come\nback but nothing is certain.. There are all sorts\nof challenges we will face. on deep space missions.. Communication delays,\nradiation protection,. isolation of the crew.. So it is not surprising\nthat some would have us. stay where we are.. There\u2019s never going\nto be zero risk.. When you\u2019re breaking the\nbonds of gravity that\u2019s. just part of the deal.. And it is one of the great\nadventures of all time.. That challenge is one that\nwe\u2019re willing to accept.. Man, in his quest for\nknowledge, cannot be deterred.. Space is not just\na destination.. It changes you forever.. It\u2019ll be tough.. Really tough.. But we have the right\npeople for the job.. We have pressed the\nqualities for success into. system after system.. This country of the United\nStates was not built by. those who waited\nand rested.. Pushed our people past\nevery failure we can dream up.. We have never been\nmore ready to meet the unknown.. Through Artemis we will\nonce again explore beyond. our world.. And we will succeed.",
