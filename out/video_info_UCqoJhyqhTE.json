This includes American Airlines, Spirit, Frontier, and Allegiant.\n\nThe not so good news is that finding an underseat travel bag that measures 18x14x8 inches or under can be tough. Most wheeled luggage is too large, and many travel backpacks are carry-on size and would need to go into the overhead bin anyway. \n\nThe stakes are even higher for Basic Economy passengers who are only allowed one personal item and run the risk of additional fees at the gate if the bag is too large to fit underneath the airplane seat.\n\nThis inspired us to make a video that not only showcases backpacks falling under the 18\u201d x 14\u201d x 8\u201d personal item bag size limit but also are great for one-bag packing so that you can say goodbye to carry-on fees for good.\n\n===========\n\nVideo Chapters\n0:00 Intro - Spirit, Frontier, American Airlines requirements\n0:56 Best Bag For Basic Economy Flights\n1:43 Expandable Underseat Backpack\n2:32 Best Laptop Backpack\n3:27 Minimalist Personal Item Backpack\n4:10 Best 18x14x8 Underseat Bag\n5:09 Most Stylish Backpack under 18x14x8\n6:01 Find More Personal Item Backpacks\n\n===========\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Subscribe for more: https://www.youtube.com/@Backpackies\n\nFor more backpack reviews and buying guides visit us at https://backpackies.com/\n\n\nIMPORTANT DISCLOSURES\n===============================\n\nAffiliate Disclosure\nBackpackies is a small project that is viewer-supported.

    "captions": ". So, you need a personal item backpack for your next\u00a0\nflight and it has to be small enough to fit underneath\u00a0\u00a0. the airplane seat in front of you. But the carry-on\u00a0\nbags you do own are way too large. And your trip\u00a0\u00a0. is coming up fast. And you're breaking out the\u00a0\ntape measure and trying not to panic. Listen, it's\u00a0\u00a0. going to be okay! Because we already did all of the\u00a0\nmeasuring for you with the bags in this video. The\u00a0\u00a0. focus will be mostly on U.S domestic Airlines\u00a0\nlike Spirit, Frontier, Allegiant and American\u00a0\u00a0. Airlines that have a personal item size limit of\u00a0\n18 x 14 x 8 inches but there will be links in\u00a0\u00a0. the video description to our buying guides for\u00a0\nother airlines if you do need an even smaller\u00a0\u00a0. personal item bag. We will be doing something\u00a0\ncalled the t-shirt test for these backpacks,\u00a0\u00a0. where we try to fit as many t-shirts as possible\u00a0\nto give you an idea of how much each one can pack.\u00a0\u00a0. So let's get right into it starting with the King\u00a0\nKong EDGE23. This is a compact backpack that\u00a0\u00a0. opens like a suitcase making it a great option for\u00a0\none-bag travel on Basic Economy flights. You get 23\u00a0\u00a0. liters of packing room and we found that it fits\u00a0\n24 t-shirts inside the main packing compartment.\u00a0\u00a0. What's great about this backpack is that it has\u00a0\nthese beefy compression straps to keep you under\u00a0\u00a0. the airline personal item size limit even if you\u00a0\npack it full. Other awesome travel features include\u00a0\u00a0. a laptop sleeve, big water bottle pockets, straps to\u00a0\nattach it to wheeled luggage and a sealed pocket\u00a0\u00a0. on the inside for shoes or dirty laundry. And\u00a0\ntrust us, this little feature makes all of the\u00a0\u00a0. difference while traveling. If you want to travel\u00a0\nwith just their personal item another great\u00a0\u00a0. bag is the Knack Pack Series 1 and we honestly\u00a0\ncan't recommend it enough. You get a hidden water\u00a0\u00a0. bottle pocket, lockable zippers an external 13-inch\u00a0\nlaptop compartment and lots and lots of pockets\u00a0\u00a0. for organization. What makes this bag special is\u00a0\nthat not only is it a daypack but it has a hidden\u00a0\u00a0. travel compartment that expands for packing. Inside\u00a0\nthe packing compartment you can fit a total of 20\u00a0\u00a0. t-shirts plus the main compartment fits another\u00a0\n8 t-shirts giving you 28 t-shirts in total.\u00a0\u00a0. Now, the Knack Pack Series 1 comes in different\u00a0\nsizes and for a personal item bag we recommend\u00a0\u00a0. going with the Small size to stay compliant. Next\u00a0\nup we have the Timbuk2 Division laptop backpack,\u00a0\u00a0. which has to be one of our favorite personal\u00a0\nitem backpacks for tech carry. Not only do you\u00a0\u00a0. get a dedicated 15-inch laptop sleeve but there is\u00a0\nanother padded sleeve inside the main compartment\u00a0\u00a0. for a second laptop or tablet. The division gives\u00a0\nyou 22 liters of packing room and we found that it\u00a0\u00a0. can fit 22 t-shirts inside the main compartment.\u00a0\nAnd it has lots of features that are great\u00a0\u00a0. for travel like a water bottle pocket, a trolley\u00a0\nsleeve to attach the bag to your carry-on luggage\u00a0\u00a0. and compression straps on the side which\u00a0\nreally helps when packing. The shoulder\u00a0\u00a0. straps and back panel are also super\u00a0\ncomfortable. I mean, just look at this\u00a0\u00a0. padding! All in all the Timbuk2 Division is a\u00a0\ngreat quality bag it is also small enough to\u00a0\u00a0. use as a personal item on more restrictive\u00a0\nairlines like JetBlue and United Airlines.\u00a0\u00a0. If you want a more minimalist style we recommend\u00a0\nthe DB hugger 20 liter backpack. You get a roomy\u00a0\u00a0. main compartment that opens nice and wide\u00a0\nand it's lined with pockets for organization.\u00a0\u00a0. And this backpack fits 19 t-shirts inside. We like\u00a0\nthe top compartment on this backpack because it\u00a0\u00a0. makes it really easy to grab items when the bag\u00a0\nis on the ground underneath the seat in front of\u00a0\u00a0. you on the airplane. Plus, it has a rear laptop\u00a0\ncompartment so you don't disturb your packing\u00a0\u00a0. when grabbing a laptop or tablet. If you want a\u00a0\nbag that's high quality, lightweight, and easy to\u00a0\u00a0. pack then the DB hugger is definitely the one to\u00a0\nget. Plus, it comes in a ton of fun colors and who\u00a0\u00a0. doesn't like that. Another great underseat bag is\u00a0\nthe Everyman Hideout 5-Way Commuter Pack. Not only\u00a0\u00a0. can you wear it like a backpack but you can also\u00a0\ncarry it like a briefcase or like a messenger bag\u00a0\u00a0. with the included strap. The Everyman Hideout\u00a0\nCommuter gives you 18 liters of packing room\u00a0\u00a0. and it even includes packing cubes and removable\u00a0\ncompression straps so everything you need for your\u00a0\u00a0. next trip is included with the bag. We found that\u00a0\nyou can easily fit 20 t-shirts inside the packing\u00a0\u00a0. compartment and the straps really help a lot with\u00a0\ncompressing everything down. There is also a second\u00a0\u00a0. TSA compliant compartment that functions like a\u00a0\nmobile office with a sleeve for your laptop and\u00a0\u00a0. lots of pockets so that everything you need is\u00a0\nright there in one spot. And one of the perks of\u00a0\u00a0. the Everyman Hideout 5-Way Commuter is that\u00a0\nyou can tuck away all of the straps to take\u00a0\u00a0. up less space underneath the airplane seat for\u00a0\nneater experience on the plane. Next up we have\u00a0\u00a0. the Everlane ReNew Transit backpack. This is one\u00a0\nof the largest bags in terms of capacity at 27\u00a0\u00a0. liters but it still surprisingly manages to stay\u00a0\nunder that 18 by 14 by 8 inch personal item size\u00a0\u00a0. limit even when packed full. We found that the main\u00a0\ncompartment can fit 24 t-shirts making it a good\u00a0\u00a0. option for short trips with a Basic Economy fare.\u00a0\nEverlane did include some great travel features\u00a0\u00a0. with this bag like a luggage strap, a separate\u00a0sleeve\nfor easy access to a laptop or tablet. It also\u00a0\u00a0. has a water bottle pocket on the outside of the\u00a0\nbag and on the inside of the main compartment if\u00a0\u00a0. you want something more discreet. If you're not\u00a0\na fan of this light color the ReNew Transit\u00a0\u00a0. does come in darker colors, if you're worried\u00a0\nabout this bag getting dirty on those airplane\u00a0\u00a0. floors. Sometimes they're sticky. So that's it\u00a0\nfor our personal item bag guide we have a ton\u00a0\u00a0. more backpacks we have tested and do recommend\u00a0\nthat didn't make this video. You can always check\u00a0\u00a0. out the links in the video description to check\u00a0\nthose out. If you're currently getting ready for\u00a0\u00a0. your next trip, we hope you have a great one!\u00a0\nAnd as always, thank you so much for watching.",
