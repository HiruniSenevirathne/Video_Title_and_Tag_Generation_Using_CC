    "captions": ". Natural disasters are part of the way the\nplanet works.. In the ideal world we would all live in places\nthat aren't affected by natural hazards.. We wouldn't live near coastlines; we wouldn't\nlive along the San Andreas fault in California;. we wouldn't live underneath the volcanoes\nin the Pacific Northwest.. But we live where our homes are.. I mean, those are the places that are important\nto us.. And then there are many people that don't\nhave choices.. The Museum is presenting this exhibit to describe\nthese events to people so they have a better. understanding of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,\nhurricanes, and tornadoes.. But more than that - to begin thinking about\nthe risks associate with them.. As climate warms, we expect there to be more\nsevere storms, more severe droughts, more. wildfires, and to some extent over the last\ndecade we've seen just that.. There's no way we're going to avoid the natural\nhazards on a dynamic Earth, but there are. certainly ways that we can learn to live with\nthem to mitigate the risks to society.",
