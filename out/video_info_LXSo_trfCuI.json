    "captions": ". Oh, would you look at that my fight departs in two hours I better start packing. Good thing i'm a minimalist. So this is personally how I pack as a minimalist. Let's start with the bag on this trip. I'll be using the packed one travel bag. I recently helped launch this product with a couple friends through an IndieGoGo campaign. It's really the perfect bag for minimalists people with OCD or serial killers. Okay, let's start packing. First I'll tuck my beard trimmer and razor in this pocket. I'm going away for a week, so let's grab five gray t-shirts. And you know what I might want to go out to a fancy dinner or something, so I'll bring a charcoal t-shirt as well. Okay, but seriously if I don't bring a button-up, Natalie is gonna kill me. Is it button-up or button-down?. I never really know... Bathing suit,. casual shorts, hiking shorts, going out in public shorts. and socks. Now I'm a filmmaker so nearly every vacation will include my camera, and usually my drone.. I'll talk the battery charger and batteries in the mesh pocket back here.. Zip this guy up.. My laptop goes in the center pocket.. I can hide the laundry bag behind this zip pocket.. I put my laptop charger in this mesh pocket here, and some additional cables and accessories for the drone,. A light jacket that I'll probably never wear.... After getting Salmonella on a trip over the holidays. I now always bring an extra pair of underwear, so let's bring eight. Alright, you know what let's just grab all these just in case. Man you know what I still have a lot of room in this thing. Why don't we bring along the framed poster for the award-winning documentary minimalism? my guitar.... another bag.... I'll pack my hiking sneakers fit the rest of my drone accessories in here,. And my headphones.. So that's all the inside contents of the bag. I'll put my iPad in the magazine pocket. Magnets will snap it shut and I'll place my passport safely inside this pocket inside a pocket. In these two pockets up front. I'll include hair product deodorant and a toothbrush. My keys I usually store my keys right in here. I'll pull out this little dope. Okay, you know. Done I was never meant to be a hand model. What's cool about this bag is if I pack right I can quickly access things like my camera. or my headphones. Or my laptop without digging through all the contents of my bag. And that is how I pack it. Can be really stressful packing especially when you're running late for your flight, but luckily since I'm a minimalist fuck that was two hours. Definitely missed my flight definitely missed my flight. If you like this video I make a lot of them subscribe to this channel for more or go to minimalist filemaker.com. if you like podcasts i've got one of those it's called the ground up show I. Interview people like Dan Harris rich roll and the minimalists to hear their stories. And how they made things happen go to ground-up show calm for the podcast. That's it. Thanks for watching",
