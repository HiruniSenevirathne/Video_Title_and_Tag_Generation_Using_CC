But lately, our fascination with sleep\nfeels as if it's taken on an urgency.. Do a quick internet search for sleep\nand you'll find a slew of articles. about how to make your sleep perfect.. New gadgets, fancy alarm clocks,. stay away from blue light.. There are lots of services, products\nand advice columns. that tell us we're sleeping wrong.. Not enough,. not quality sleep, wrong position.. Even worse, you might find\nscary messaging. claiming that if you're not sleeping right. your life is going to be shorter,. you're going to get all kinds of diseases.. One of the biggest worries\nwe have about our sleep. is that we're not getting enough. and that anything less\nthan seven hours a night. means that we\u2019re doomed to bad health,. everything from high blood pressure\nto Alzheimer\u2019s disease.. But there are two flaws\nwith this kind of messaging.. The first flaw is that it's not\ncompletely accurate.. Seven to eight hours of sleep,. while recommended for adults,\nis just an average.. And while messages have to be simplified\nfor health communication to the public,. sometimes important nuances get lost.. So yes, it's true that not getting\nenough sleep in the long term. is associated with health problems\nlike cardiovascular disease,. diabetes and depression.. But fixating solely\non seven to eight hours. ignores the fact that there's a range\nof sleep that people need.. The duration of a good night's sleep\ncan be different for different people.. Some adults need eight,\nbut some are just fine on six.. The second flaw with this kind\nof doomsday messaging. is that it can be counterproductive,. especially for people\nwho do have trouble sleeping.. For instance, in 2019,. it was estimated that 21 percent\nof adults in the US. were wearing sleep tracking devices.. And that number is probably growing.. And I get it.. It's fascinating to see how much sleep\nyou've gotten each night. and to know what part of your night\nwas spent in deep sleep or dreaming.. But having all of that sleep data. is causing some people\nto become obsessed with it,. so much so that it\u2019s leading\nto a condition some call orthosomnia:. a preoccupation with the constant need\nto achieve perfect sleep.. And this condition, ironically,\nis causing more sleep problems.. Now orthosomnia might be\nan extreme example,. but the anxiety of not\ngetting enough sleep. is keeping some of us up at night.. So here's what some experts are saying.. Stop fixating on the number. because that can lead to unrealistic\nexpectations of sleep.. According to Dr. Colleen Carney,. a psychologist and the head\nof the Ryerson University Sleep Lab,. the basic questions\nyou should ask yourself are:. Do I feel reasonably\nwell-rested during the day?. Do I generally sleep through\nthe night without disturbances?. Or, if I wake, do I fall\nback asleep easily?. Can I stay awake through the day\nwithout involuntarily falling asleep?. If your answers are yes to all three,. you probably don't need\nto worry about your sleep.. And if you're struggling with your sleep,. instead of buying\nexpensive blue light filters. or fancy sleep trackers,. try talking with your doctor to make sure\nthere aren't any medical conditions. that need to be explored first.. Then try evidence-based recommendations. laid out by the American\nAcademy of Sleep Medicine.. What's really cool is that there's\na highly effective therapy. called cognitive behavioral therapy\nfor insomnia, or CBT-I,. It doesn\u2019t have\nany medications involved.. And it has a really low failure rate.",
