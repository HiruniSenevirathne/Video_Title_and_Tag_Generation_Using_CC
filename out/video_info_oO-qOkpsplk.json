Borealis is a great option if you prefer. built-in organization you can store a. tiny Tech in an admin panel in the. separate laptop compartment lets you. pull out your device without disturbing. the packing Cube gives you carefully. Tetris into place though it's a little. smaller than a traditional travel. backpack you can squeeze items like a. packable jacket in the front bungee if. you need a little bit more storage room. [Music]. [Applause]. even with the bag's built-in. organization adding additional pouches. and cubes can help you organize it all. whether you're packing Tech clothing or. toiletries there are a ton of different. options out there plus staying organized. reduces the chances of you leaving. anything behind you'll keep track of. every cord dongle and Battery Bank you. brought when you refill the loops and. pockets of a tech pouch it can be easy. to over pack smaller kits though so make. sure you're grabbing a pouch that fits. your wall charger cord Mouse and other. Essentials that you bring along. similarly you'll need a toiletry pouch. that's big enough to fit all of your. gear dedicated Pockets give you a spot. for things you'll want to keep separate. from the rest like a toothbrush or a. razor another feature to look for is a. built-in hook like Peak design has on. their wash pouch it turns the kit on its. side so you can see everything at once. and it's like getting an additional. Shelf at your Airbnb for your. accommodation to hold your gear there's. also a small wash pouch if you have less. to carry you'll save two inches of. height without sacrificing much. organization as for packing cubes. consider mixing and matching different. sizes smaller cubes are great for socks. and other tiny gear and you can use. larger cubes to separate your tops and. pants or sort by outfit whichever you. prefer Cube setup in clamshell are. easiest to pack since they lay flat the. Patagonia black hole cubes even have. mesh dividers so you can toss underwear. on one side and still have room for. tanks and tees on the other when you. need new travel Essentials like pouches. and packing cubes turn to this video. sponsor Backcountry they've got tons of. accessories from top brands to help keep. you organized on your trip filter their. site by travel gear then fine tune your. search by size capacity and more to find. that perfect one bag travel pack their. product pages are filled with detailed. info to help you make the best choice to. suit your style too Backcountry has. something for everyone whether you need. a new carry-on or the gear to pack. inside of it pick up some Patagonia. black hole cubes to keep your clothing. in check and use the Eagle Creek eTools. organizer to manage your charging cables. when you get to the airport you'll have. easy access to your credit card and the. if you're having kanken card wall call. it to pay for snacks then fill your new. Hydro Flask or Yeti water bottle one. last time before you board the plane if. you need advice on what gear will work. best for you turn to one of. backcountry's gear heads they're. available 24 7 via web chat email or. phone and have the knowledge to help you. decide plus use the Lincoln code down in. the description below for 15 off your. first order over at backcountry.com now. back to the gear. the right Tech will help you stay. connected while you're on the road. however that doesn't mean that you need. to load up on cables and Chargers. optimizing your tech gear will save you. space and weight in the long run an easy. place to start is by bringing a. universal cable instead of a cable for. every device look for one with ends you. can mix and match to find the perfect. combination like the rolling Square. InCharge XL it can flip between USBC. usb-a lightning and micro USB and comes. in multiple lengths it's nice to have a. longer cord so you don't have to camp. out next to the plug in your room and. have a shorter cord on the plane you can. also opt for a battery Bank to charge at. your seat instead they're also great. when you hit your destination so you can. top up your phone midday instead of. heading back to your accommodations or. finding a coffee shop with a spare plug. while tiny battery banks are lighter and. easier to fit in a pocket we'll trade a. larger footprint to get more out of a. charge that way you'll have enough power. to pull up your boarding pass on your. phone and listen to a podcast with your. fully charged airpods. foreign. hydration is vital to bouncing back from. Gel leg and giving you all the energy. you need to explore a new place however. water bottles can take up a lot of room. in your bag and they can be heavy as. well choose one with a compressible. design to cut down on space and weight. they're lighter than metal or plastic. bottles and are great if your pack lacks. a dedicated water bottle pocket you can. clip it with a carabiner to your pack. and fill it up after you've gone through. TSA when you're done sipping compress it. down so there's less to tote the. hydropac stash collapsible one liter. water bottle packs down to the size of. two hockey pucks or for you. non-midwesterners a giant cupcake. for an even more compact option try the. vapor Eclipse water bottle since it. rolls up to be the size of its Carabiner. and cap it's worth noting that you'll. sacrifice insulation for packability to. keep drinks colder or hotter for longer. opt for an insulated bottle fill it up. with water after you pass through the. security line to stay hydrated on the. plane you can also fill it with coffee. at your hotel's breakfast bar to avoid. using paper cups we like Hydro flasks. lightweight standard mouth trail series. bottle because it's 25 lighter than. their other standard bottles thanks to. the loop handle on its cap you can still. clip it to your bag with a carabiner too. together. [Applause]. the weather forecast can change in an. instant even if you think you're heading. into blue skies and sunshine it's better. to be prepared a packable jacket keeps. you safe from the elements without. taking up too much space we like jackets. that pack into their own pocket so we. don't have to keep track of a separate. stuff sack of course your choices depend. on where you're going lighter jackets. are better if you're more likely to be. fending off wind and rain than a. snowstorm look for something breathable. that compresses down into a small. package like the Outdoor Research helium. rain jacket we also recommend a rain. jacket that will keep your hood tight to. your head so you can stay dry even when. riding through a torrential downpour on. the back of a scooter in Thailand you'll. want something a little heavier for. cooler temps luckily there are options. that pack down smaller than the big. puffy coat you wear at home packable. coats like the Patagonia micropuff. managed to store a ton of warmth in a. thinner design it's usually best for 35. to 50 degree weather but you can always. layer up if it's colder. foreign. cards to business cards your wallet can. grow before your eyes slimming it down. is another way to keep your one bag. travels to just the essentials plus a. minimalist wallet fits into the tiniest. of slings and into pants pockets for. easy everyday carry there are lots of. different styles to choose from while. some strictly hold a few cards others. manage to contain cards coins and cash. in a smaller package than a traditional. leather trifold if you need to carry. International currency look for a while. like the fjal robin kanken Card Wallet. you can put cards in one side and slip. bills and coins into the other with the. space in between for a tiny travel pen. or receipts if you're worried about. important things falling out it can be. nice to have a wall That's Zips shut. while sometimes the paper or cash can. get stuck in the Zipper at least they. won't slip out of your pocket if you're. hopping from place to place a passport. wallet keeps all the IDS you need in one. spot with dedicated pockets for travel. documents cards and cash you'll ease. your way through customs without digging. through your travel backpack while it's. like the Pioneer passport are larger. than traditional minimalist wads yet. still Slimmer than a traditional. billfold. [Music]. [Applause]. whether you're going by plane train or. automobile travel takes time and whether. it's a long flight or lengthy layover. sometimes we all need a little. distraction and that's why it's. essential to leave a little bit of room. for entertainment corded headphones are. great for in-flight movies so we. recommend bringing them along either. that or a Bluetooth transmitter for your. wireless earbuds it's worth noting that. noise cancellation can do wonders to. drown out fellow passengers and a loud. plane as you listen to an audiobook. playlist or even White Noise plus if you. go with wireless it's easier to get some. sleep without worrying about getting. tangled up in the cord if you're a book. person bring along an e-reader instead. of a paper copy it'll save a ton of. space and weight and you can buy a new. Reed right when you finish the old one. no matter where you are in the world. it's nice to have entertainment not tied. to the screen too on your layover bust. out some travel cards for a quick game. of Solitaire or go fish while waiting to. board they also come in handy for making. new friends at the local pub after all. you'll never know who you'll meet on. your travels so there you have it travel.
