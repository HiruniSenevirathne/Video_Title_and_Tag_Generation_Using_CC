    "captions": ". This is a Story of an EAGLE. A Eagle has the longest life-span of its species.\u00a0\u00a0. It can live up to 70 years.\u00a0. But to reach this age, the eagle\u00a0\nmust make a very difficult decision!\u00a0. In its 40th year, the eagle\u2019s long and\u00a0\nflexible Talons can no longer grab a prey\u00a0\u00a0. which serves as food.\u00a0. Its long and sharp beak becomes bent.\u00a0. Its old-aged and heavy wings,\u00a0\ndue to their thick feathers,\u00a0\u00a0. stick to its chest and make it difficult to fly.\u00a0. Then, the eagle is left with only two options:\u00a0. DIE or go through a painful process of CHANGE!. The process requires the eagle to fly\u00a0\nto a mountain top and sit on its nest.\u00a0\u00a0. There the eagle knocks its beak\u00a0\nagainst a rock until it plucks it out.\u00a0. Then the eagle will wait for the new beak to grow\u00a0\nback after which it will pluck out its talons.\u00a0\u00a0. When new talons grow back, the eagle\u00a0\nstarts plucking its old-aged feathers.\u00a0. And after this,. the eagle takes its famous\u00a0\nflight of rebirth and LIVES for 30 more years!!\u00a0. Why is Change needed?\u00a0. To survive and live. . We too have\u00a0\nto start the change process.\u00a0. We also have to pluck our unpleasant\u00a0\nmemories, . negative habits and our fixed mindset.\u00a0. Only Freed from the past burdens. can we take\u00a0advantage of the present. ",
