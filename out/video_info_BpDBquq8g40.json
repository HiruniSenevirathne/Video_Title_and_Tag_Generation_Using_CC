    "title": "Packing Cubes: What I learned after living out of them for 1.5 years carry-on luggage only",
    "description": "Minimalist packing, traveling with a carry-on luggage only and living out of my travel backpack for the last 1.5 years has taught me a lot about packing and organization. One of the most important lessons I learned is that packing cubes can help to make packing and organizing items much easier when traveling. \nBut they are not always necessary. \nPacking cubes are a great way to store and organize clothes and other items in luggage, but all of them have different use-cases.\nIn this video, I\u2019ll be discussing the most asked questions about packing cubes:\n* Do you need them?\n* Do you need packing cubes with compression?\n* I will also talk about the differences between folding, rolling, and the Konmari packing method (my favorite method as a minimalist traveler).\n* I will also share three packing tips. \nSo, if you\u2019re looking to organize your travel gear and make packing easier while you travel, then watch the video to learn more about packing cubes. :)\n\nThe Packing Cubes I show in this video (Amazon Affiliate Links):\nAmazon Basics Packing Cube (Size M) - https://amzn.to/3RVZ4fT\nPeak Design Packing Cube (Size S) - https://amzn.to/3YeoVBI\nEagle Creek Spectre Compression (Size S) - https://amzn.to/3JTcqHx\nSea to Summit Dry Bag - https://amzn.to/40F4n70 (The tiny one I show in the video is 2 liters)\n\u201eAroma Clothes Flavor Bags\u201c \ud83d\ude02 - I use something similar to this: https://amzn.to/3Yuw5Sc (but you can also make your own out of lavender flowers)\nMy backpack - Osprey Arcane Duffel - https://amzn.to/3X8PE1v\n\n\n00:00 Intro Blabla\n00:42 Do you need a packing cube?\n02:16 Do you need compression packing cubes?\n03:06 It all depends on the shape\n03:41 Why I don\u2018t roll or fold\n05:14 My favorite way: Konmari\n06:56 3 Tips",

    "captions": ". So there is one question that seems. to split the packing\ncommunity into two groups.. The question is: Should you\nuse packing cubes or not?. And then the debate goes on.. Should you use a packing cube from Peak\nDesign or isn't Eagle Creek much better?. Should you roll your clothes\nor should you fold them?. But in my opinion, this argument\nis really easy to settle.. Every trip is different.. No two trips are the same.. And in my opinion, all those products or. using no packing cubes,\nthey all have their strengths. and weaknesses and need\nto be packed differently.. And I'm going to share with you. my educated opinion of things\nI learned about packing cubes.. And let me know what's\nyour favorite way to pack.. The goal is just to keep all your things. contained in one space and not have a big\nmess when you arrive at your destination.. I personally travel mainly without\na packing cube when I go on hiking trips.. We usually go on trips for several days. and I like to roll outfits\nfor one day into one roll.. So as you can see here, I took a t shirt,\nthen I added my shorts, some underwear,. some socks, everything I need for the next\nday, and then I just roll it all up. into one compact roll\nthat stays together by itself.. In my opinion,. a packing cube is everything\nthat just holds your things together.. So you can also use just a plastic\nbag to keep your things together.. Or like in my husband's backpack has this. compartments with zippers that also\nwork like a packing cube.. Apart from hiking and when I need more. than one outfit,\nI personally prefer to travel with packing. cubes just because I usually go\non long trips for several months.. I have a backpack that's just a big bucket\nso I need the organization and I. don\u2019t want everything\nto fall all over the place.. And the third thing is\nthat I am very lazy.. I don't unpack at my destination.. I just put my whole backpack\nas it is into the closet.. I zip it open, I zip open my packing\ncube and that's how I live.. And then the next thing for me is that\npacking cubes are not only for clothes.. I have one packing cube where I keep all. the other random small bags and stuff that\nwould otherwise fly around in my bag.. So the first type is just a regular. packing cube like this\none that my husband uses.. It's just very simple, square,\nnothing special.. And then the other type is\ncompression packing cubes.. And do you really need\na compression packing cube?. In my opinion, no.. Because I used to travel in the past. with a big packing cube like this and I\njust had the perfect amount of clothes. to fill this up and then there would be no\neffect with any compression whatsoever.. Nowadays I travel with compression bags,. but just because I like the form, not\nbecause I really need the compression.. And I have two different ones.. I have the one from Peak Design\nand the one from Eagle Creek, which are,. I think, two of the most\npopular models that are out there.. But as you can see, apart from the form,. they have two very\ndistinctive differences.. When you look at it from the side,\nyou will see that even though. the compression is closed,\nit still has a wall on the side.. Compared to the Eagle Creek\nthat totally zips the side wall shut.. Another thing that influences the way\nyou can pack them is the way they open.. For example, the Peak Design can open all. the way, but the Eagle Creek only\nopens partially, more or less halfway.. Okay, let's start with method\nnumber one, regular folding.. In my opinion, it's not the most useful. method, but you can use it\nin all three packing cubes.. Here, where you only open partially,\nit's very difficult to get things out.. And also here, in this one,\nwhen it's open like this all the way. and you have to get something out\nfrom the bottom, it is not very useful.. At least I cannot do it\nwithout making a huge mess.. And also in a deep bucket like this,. I find it very hard to see what's\nat the bottom of the thing.. So I only find it useful for things\nyou don't need to access all the time.. And actually,. regular folding is the method that I used\nhere in this Eagle Creek packing cube.. What I have in here is a rain jacket,\nlong pants, and my hoodie.. I packed it all into here.. And now that I'm in Brazil\nand we have +30\u00b0C. and I'm sweating\u2026\nI don't access this at all.. I always just keep this somewhere. in my bag until the day\nthat I will need it again.. The next method that many\npeople use is rolling.. And apart from rolling my hiking clothes,. which I talked about in the beginning,\nthis is not my preferred method because. I cannot roll things without\nmessing them up.. And in my opinion, in the Peak Design,\nfor the way I travel and for my clothes,. it would not make sense either because I\nhave all this volume here. And if I roll. them, I have to stack them on top of each\nother and then I don't find things again.. Rolling, I think, is probably a good idea. for a packing cube like this,\nwhere you have a lot of space.. So the third way, and my preferred\nway of doing it, is the KonMari way.. Many years ago, I started with this\nwhen I still had an apartment.. I started to organize all\nmy things standing in a drawer.. And in my opinion,\nthis packing cube is the perfect. substitute for any drawer because you\nhave all this volume here on the side.. The nice thing about the KonMari method\nis that everything is folded standing up.. They can even stand by themselves.. And you can always see everything\nthat's in your packing cube.. And I also can take things\nin and out when I need them.. And since things are standing in there,. even when it gets more empty,\nthings are not falling all over the place,. especially for someone like me who does\nnot unpack and really lives out of this. thing, it's so useful that I can just\nput things in and out as I need them.. But again, this method will not work very\nwell on something like the Eagle Creek. one, because you cannot\nopen it all the way.. On the other hand, it works very\nwell with a normal packing cube.. When I had a bigger one in the past,. I just always had two rows\nof things stacked in there.. But the more I optimized my things,\nthis size just got too big for me.. And this one small packing cube\nfrom Peak Design really carries all. the clothes I need, apart from the backup\ncold weather gear that I bring with me.. So, as you can see,. the reason why I'm using this is not\nreally the compression,. it's just the form factor when\nit's compressed and when I use it.. But I also really enjoy the high\nwalls when it's uncompressed.. It gives the whole thing\na little bit more structure.. And I have three more tips for you.. The first one would be that. bigger Ziplock bags make awesome\ncompression packing cubes.. What I did in the past is just put. my clothes in a Ziplock bag,\nclose it all the way,. just leave a little bit,\n1 cm, open at the end,. and then kneel on it to get all\nthe air out and just close it shut.. That was awesome.. It worked very well.. My clothes never got that small\nwith any other method.. But honestly, traveling full time,. I would destroy the Ziploc bags every\nfew weeks and then it's not practical.. That's why I use packing cubes.. Tip number two, especially when you travel\na lot and when you wash on the road like I. do, what we keep inside our bags is\nthis little aroma clothes flavor bags.. You can purchase them everywhere.. We always make sure to have one inside.. And then our clothes always\nsmell nice while traveling.. And the third thing is,\nif you have something that's very big,. like a puff jacket, but is full of air,\nthen use either a big Ziploc bag or, what. also works very well,\nis dry bags like this.. A little bit bigger size\nthan this, obviously.. But when you just get all the air out. and then roll it up and seal it airtight,\nthen it takes up much less space.. Usually I would give you\nthe recommendation to just try out what. works for you, but I know\nthat packing cubes are expensive.. And for me, traveling full time,\nI have no apartment.. These things are basically\nmy wardrobe and my closet.. So I have no bad feeling purchasing\nthem when I find a new one that I like.. But I know that it's not\na thing that everybody can do.. And that's why I hope that this\nvideo gave you a few more ideas.. Let me know how you like to travel,. if you use them, which ones\nyou use, what works for you.. I'm curious to hear it.. If you want to see more videos from me. about minimalist packing,\nI will link the playlist right here.. And other than that, thanks for watching.. And see you in the next video.. Bye!",
