    "captions": ". KAMRI: Hey guys, it's Kamri.. My friends and I are\nhaving a movie night. and I'm making some popcorn.. Popcorn is just one of those\nweird things that I always. took for granted.. How does it pop and why does\nit transform from a crunchy. kernel to fluffy\nwhite popcorn?. I'm gonna need\nsome help for this.. Thankfully, National\nGeographic Kids sent me. their expert in popcorn popping.. Here she is now!. ASHER: Hey Kamri!. I'm Asher Jay, a National\nGeographic Explorer and a. creative conservationist.. My friends call me\nthe Popcorn Pilgrim.. I'm always looking for kernels\nlike yourself to transform.. KAMRI: Really?. ASHER: Yes, I used to be in\nfashion and I'm a big fan of. instant makeovers.. Popcorn is an instant\nmakeover if I ever saw one.. KAMRI: OK, so what\nare popcorn kernels?. Are they just dried\nup pieces of corn?. ASHER: A popcorn kernel\nis corn, just a different. species of corn than what\nwe eat at a barbeque.. A kernel of popcorn\nhas a stronger shell,. or hull, which makes it\nbetter at trapping steam.. KAMRI: How does trapping steam\nmake a popcorn kernel pop?. ASHER: Each of these kernels\nis like nature's little. pressure cooker.. When heat is\nadded to the seed,. the moisture inside\nthem turns to steam,. filling the inside\nof the kernel.. KAMRI: Like a tea kettle!\nASHER: Exactly!. Except, the steam\nhas nowhere to go.. KAMRI: Because of the\nkernel's strong hull.. ASHER: Bingo.. Eventually, enough steam\npressure builds inside the. kernel that it bursts\nthrough the kernel's shell.. KAMRI: So is the popping the\nsound of the shell breaking?. ASHER: It's actually the\nsound of steam rushing\nout of the kernel.. Kind of like the popping sound\nof opening a soda bottle.. KAMRI: So what's the\nwhite stuff of popcorn?. ASHER: That stuff is\nthe starch of the kernel.. It's stored food\nthe seed consumes. to grow into a sprout.. KAMRI: Popcorn is amazing!. To get a better perspective,\nI think we'll have to see. one of those kernels\nup close and personal.. ASHER: Yes. Wait, what?. KAMRI: We'll just\nenlarge a popcorn seed. and see how it all works.. Stand back!. ASHER: Amazing! OK.. This is the seed's hull.\nIt protects the seed.. KAMRI: And also\ntraps the steam.. ASHER: This is the endosperm.. It's the starch that\nis the seed's fuel to\ngrow into a plant.. KAMRI: So when\nthe kernel pops,. it bursts out of the\nshell and becomes the. fluffy, tasty part of popcorn.. ASHER: And this is\nthe seed's germ.. It's the part of the plant\nthat would develop if the. seed were to grow on its own.. KAMRI: It's getting hot\nin here, like a sauna.. ASHER: That's the steam,\nbuilding inside the shell.. KAMRI: Wait, that means\nthis kernel's ready to.. Whoa!. Now that you know\nhow that works,. catch up on all the other\nepisodes of How Things Work. by clicking right here.. And also make sure you\nsubscribe to Nat Geo Kids. by clicking down here..
