    "description": "What does it **really** feel like to jump from space? In 2012 Felix Baumgartner took a helium balloon into the stratosphere and skydived back to earth in a specially made space suit. Whilst in freefall he broke the speed of sound and entered a spin which threatened the entire Red Bull Stratos mission... Felix reflects on his achievement and shares what it really felt like to jump from the edge of space. \n\ncheck out the full story behind Red Bull Stratos in _'Space Jump'_ on Red Bull TV https://www.redbullstratos.com  \n\n#RedBull #GivesYouWiiings #RedBullStratos\n_________________________________________________\nExperience the world of Red Bull like you have never seen it before with the best action sports clips on the web, original series and livestreams.\n\nGet the FREE Red Bull TV apps for all your devices: http://win.gs/RedBullTVApps  \nSubscribe to Red Bull on Youtube: http://win.gs/SubToRedBull\nCheck out Red Bull on TikTok: https://win.gs/TikTok\nRed Bull on Facebook: http://win.gs/redbullfb\nRed Bull on Instagram: http://win.gs/RedBullInstagram\nRed Bull on Twitter: http://win.gs/redbulltwitter",

    "captions": ". I'm the guy who jumped from space. [Music]. I wanted to be the first human outside. of an aircraft breaking the sound. barrier. wait twice the weight that I normally. have and it's very difficult to do a. perfect exit do not over rotate because. if I start over rotating there's no air. that you can use to slow down. foreign. [Applause]. first 25 seconds it looked like. everything is under control. [Applause]. and after 34 seconds I hit Mach 1 and I. broke the speed of sound. was that him breaking them yeah. that was alcohol I wanted to be the. first human outside of an aircraft. breaking the sound barrier. because of the fact that a lot of those. scientists said prior to the jump you're. gonna spin like crazy and the other half. said we don't think anything is going to. happen. I was mentally prepared to spin but I. was hoping. that I'm not going to spend now if you. watch the next couple seconds you see at. that moment it slowly starts to spin. it's getting faster. the problem is there's no protocol. there's nobody in the world telling you. listening Felix if this happens you have. to do this while the whole world is. watching then I was trying to move my. arms around a little bit just maybe it. does something and then it stopped for a. second but now it starts getting the. opposite direction you know and then it. really ramps up at that moment it's not. about breaking records anymore at that. moment it's all about survival. speed 600 miles per hour there's only. one way for the blood to leave your. skull and that's through all the. eyeballs if that happens you're gonna. die. I had a chiwis attached to my hand that. she wishes a device that it fires a drug. shoot that pulls you out of that flat. spin that's why I put my hands in. the trick that that G whisp it's less. Chi and now the cheese whiz senses oh. less cheated means he's getting it under. control I turned around and that was. stable as well. so when you look at my suit you know the. more you fall the more depressurized the. suit gets and here you can already see. the suit flapping. look at the sky. it's blue now so we went from black Sky. back to Blue Sky. if you look at the right corner Luke was. dropping some flares and it gives me the. perfect direction for the wings now this. is a very important moment. [Music]. very first time after hours and hours. inside that spacesuit that I'm breathing. regular air. so now I'm really happy because even the. landing worked just perfect. [Applause]. [Music]",
