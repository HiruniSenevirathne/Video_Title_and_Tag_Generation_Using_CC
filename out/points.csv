0,84LtRsstGl8,6 AMAZINGLY Compact Ways to Fold Clothes for Packing PART TWO,"Watch this quick video to learn the most compact packing techniques out there. Using the methods taught in this video will allow you to take more clothes with you on your trip, or, leave more space for souvenirs. 

I made a part two of this video as I've learned a few new methods since the first video and I also now use packing cubes and wouldn't be without them. Packing cubes really are a godsend when it comes to keeping things organised and quickly accessing whatever you want from your backpack. I hope this video gives you an idea of how much they can help.

1,BpDBquq8g40,Packing Cubes: What I learned after living out of them for 1.5 years carry-on luggage only,"Minimalist packing, traveling with a carry-on luggage only and living out of my travel backpack for the last 1.5 years has taught me a lot about packing and organization. One of the most important lessons I learned is that packing cubes can help to make packing and organizing items much easier when traveling. 
But they are not always necessary. 
Packing cubes are a great way to store and organize clothes and other items in luggage, but all of them have different use-cases.
In this video, I’ll be discussing the most asked questions about packing cubes:
* Do you need them?
* Do you need packing cubes with compression?
* I will also talk about the differences between folding, rolling, and the Konmari packing method (my favorite method as a minimalist traveler).
* I will also share three packing tips. 
So, if you’re looking to organize your travel gear and make packing easier while you travel, then watch the video to learn more about packing cubes. :)

06:56 3 Tips","['minimalist packing', 'packing cubes', 'carry on only', 'handluggage only', 'peak design', 'peak design packing cube', 'eagle creek', 'eagle creek packing cube', 'packing tips', 'packing hacks', 'minimalist travel', 'reisetips', 'reisegepäck', 'travel luggage', 'personal item', 'travel with less', 'minimalism', 'travel bag', 'travel bag organisation', 'how to pack', 'pack with me', 'packing list', 'carry-on luggage', 'one bag travel', 'travel backpack']",Maggi Fuchs,2023-02-07T19:35:48Z,". So there is one question that seems. to split the packing
community into two groups.. The question is: Should you
use packing cubes or not?. And then the debate goes on.. Should you use a packing cube from Peak
Design or isn't Eagle Creek much better?. Should you roll your clothes
or should you fold them?. But in my opinion, this argument
is really easy to settle.. Every trip is different.. No two trips are the same.. And in my opinion, all those products or. using no packing cubes,
they all have their strengths. and weaknesses and need
to be packed differently.. And I'm going to share with you. my educated opinion of things
I learned about packing cubes.. And let me know what's
your favorite way to pack.. The goal is just to keep all your things. contained in one space and not have a big
mess when you arrive at your destination.. I personally travel mainly without
a packing cube when I go on hiking trips.. We usually go on trips for several days. and I like to roll outfits
for one day into one roll.. So as you can see here, I took a t shirt,
then I added my shorts, some underwear,. some socks, everything I need for the next
day, and then I just roll it all up. into one compact roll
that stays together by itself.. In my opinion,. a packing cube is everything
that just holds your things together.. So you can also use just a plastic
bag to keep your things together.. Or like in my husband's backpack has this. compartments with zippers that also
work like a packing cube.. Apart from hiking and when I need more. than one outfit,
I personally prefer to travel with packing. cubes just because I usually go
on long trips for several months.. I have a backpack that's just a big bucket
so I need the organization and I. don’t want everything
to fall all over the place.. And the third thing is
that I am very lazy.. I don't unpack at my destination.. I just put my whole backpack
as it is into the closet.. I zip it open, I zip open my packing
cube and that's how I live.. And then the next thing for me is that
packing cubes are not only for clothes.. I have one packing cube where I keep all. the other random small bags and stuff that
would otherwise fly around in my bag.. So the first type is just a regular. packing cube like this
one that my husband uses.. It's just very simple, square,
nothing special.. And then the other type is
compression packing cubes.. And do you really need
a compression packing cube?. In my opinion, no.. Because I used to travel in the past. with a big packing cube like this and I
just had the perfect amount of clothes. to fill this up and then there would be no
effect with any compression whatsoever.. Nowadays I travel with compression bags,. but just because I like the form, not
because I really need the compression.. And I have two different ones.. I have the one from Peak Design
and the one from Eagle Creek, which are,. I think, two of the most
popular models that are out there.. But as you can see, apart from the form,. they have two very
distinctive differences.. When you look at it from the side,
you will see that even though. the compression is closed,
it still has a wall on the side.. Compared to the Eagle Creek
that totally zips the side wall shut.. Another thing that influences the way
you can pack them is the way they open.. For example, the Peak Design can open all. the way, but the Eagle Creek only
opens partially, more or less halfway.. Okay, let's start with method
number one, regular folding.. In my opinion, it's not the most useful. method, but you can use it
in all three packing cubes.. Here, where you only open partially,
it's very difficult to get things out.. And also here, in this one,
when it's open like this all the way. and you have to get something out
from the bottom, it is not very useful.. At least I cannot do it
without making a huge mess.. And also in a deep bucket like this,. I find it very hard to see what's
at the bottom of the thing.. So I only find it useful for things
you don't need to access all the time.. And actually,. regular folding is the method that I used
here in this Eagle Creek packing cube.. What I have in here is a rain jacket,
long pants, and my hoodie.. I packed it all into here.. And now that I'm in Brazil
and we have +30°C. and I'm sweating…
I don't access this at all.. I always just keep this somewhere. in my bag until the day
that I will need it again.. The next method that many
people use is rolling.. And apart from rolling my hiking clothes,. which I talked about in the beginning,
this is not my preferred method because. I cannot roll things without
messing them up.. And in my opinion, in the Peak Design,
for the way I travel and for my clothes,. it would not make sense either because I
have all this volume here. And if I roll. them, I have to stack them on top of each
other and then I don't find things again.. Rolling, I think, is probably a good idea. for a packing cube like this,
where you have a lot of space.. So the third way, and my preferred
way of doing it, is the KonMari way.. Many years ago, I started with this
when I still had an apartment.. I started to organize all
my things standing in a drawer.. And in my opinion,
this packing cube is the perfect. substitute for any drawer because you
have all this volume here on the side.. The nice thing about the KonMari method
is that everything is folded standing up.. They can even stand by themselves.. And you can always see everything
that's in your packing cube.. And I also can take things
in and out when I need them.. And since things are standing in there,. even when it gets more empty,
things are not falling all over the place,. especially for someone like me who does
not unpack and really lives out of this. thing, it's so useful that I can just
put things in and out as I need them.. But again, this method will not work very
well on something like the Eagle Creek. one, because you cannot
open it all the way.. On the other hand, it works very
well with a normal packing cube.. When I had a bigger one in the past,. I just always had two rows
of things stacked in there.. But the more I optimized my things,
this size just got too big for me.. And this one small packing cube
from Peak Design really carries all. the clothes I need, apart from the backup
cold weather gear that I bring with me.. So, as you can see,. the reason why I'm using this is not
really the compression,. it's just the form factor when
it's compressed and when I use it.. But I also really enjoy the high
walls when it's uncompressed.. It gives the whole thing
a little bit more structure.. And I have three more tips for you.. The first one would be that. bigger Ziplock bags make awesome
compression packing cubes.. What I did in the past is just put. my clothes in a Ziplock bag,
close it all the way,. just leave a little bit,
1 cm, open at the end,. and then kneel on it to get all
the air out and just close it shut.. That was awesome.. It worked very well.. My clothes never got that small
with any other method.. But honestly, traveling full time,. I would destroy the Ziploc bags every
few weeks and then it's not practical.. That's why I use packing cubes.. Tip number two, especially when you travel
a lot and when you wash on the road like I. do, what we keep inside our bags is
this little aroma clothes flavor bags.. You can purchase them everywhere.. We always make sure to have one inside.. And then our clothes always
smell nice while traveling.. And the third thing is,
if you have something that's very big,. like a puff jacket, but is full of air,
then use either a big Ziploc bag or, what. also works very well,
is dry bags like this.. A little bit bigger size
than this, obviously.. But when you just get all the air out. and then roll it up and seal it airtight,
then it takes up much less space.. Usually I would give you
the recommendation to just try out what. works for you, but I know
that packing cubes are expensive.. And for me, traveling full time,
I have no apartment.. These things are basically
my wardrobe and my closet.. So I have no bad feeling purchasing
them when I find a new one that I like.. But I know that it's not
a thing that everybody can do.. And that's why I hope that this
video gave you a few more ideas.. Let me know how you like to travel,. if you use them, which ones
you use, what works for you.. I'm curious to hear it.. If you want to see more videos from me. about minimalist packing,
I will link the playlist right here.. And other than that, thanks for watching.. And see you in the next video.. Bye!",8573,1639

[Music]. hi my name is Tiffany and I travel for. work and for fun here are some of my. packing tips to pack a little bit. lighter we're gonna pack three weeks. into this backpack I usually bring about. three shoe options because most of my. vacations consist of nature and being in. a city I will mostly wear comfortable. walking shoes and then I'll also bring. some flats for dressier occasions and. then also hiking boots for outdoor. activities try to use every inch of. space use it inside of your shoes for. things like extra socks underwear. swimsuits belts anything that is soft. and can fit put it in there I like to. put the hiking shoes and shoes and bags. just in case they get dirty and I keep. it at the bottom so the bags not. top-heavy with clothes fold over your. pants and then fold over the shirt in. the middle so it's basically putting a. perfect line you can put your socks and. underwear here so you have your whole. outfit picked out for the day I like to. roll everything I find that this saves. space and can also help with some. wrinkles I will usually wear something. two three times and a trip unless. they're dirty or also unless I have. access to laundry also bring a dress. just for nicer occasions for whenever we. go out so this folding method is. something that I've learned and I use it. for single items more so and then you. bring the arms into the middle and make. it into a straight rectangle turn it. over and you roll it in the bottom part. that you rolled you tuck everything else. in it and you just have a little burrito. baby. you can do it with pretty much anything. this rolling method is great for pajamas. or anything lightweight and then just. tightly roll it up voila so we're gonna. have four outfits a dress and a jacket. some pajamas and then. outfit to wear cuz you're always gonna. be wearing something hopefully I always. bring a lightweight reusable water. bottle it helps save money and also. reduces from plastic use and I bring a. small going out bags I'm not gonna bring. this big old backpack with me every time. I go out when I'm on a trip I leave this. at home and I bring this small bag it. holds everything that I need my passport. money. I saw a hack online where you can put. credit cards and money in a minting and. that's kind of also a good way to hide. some of your money if I know that rain. is in the forecast. I will bring a small umbrella if you're. out in nature you can also bring a. poncho to save some space I only try to. bring what I going to need leave big. bottles at home so putting in a contact. case is a great solution it's compact. and if I'm on a flight or in high. altitude you know it's not gonna burst. out of the bottle if you know you might. need to do laundry you can pack a little. bit into a small container if you're. worried about toiletry spilling putting. some plastic wrap over the top and then. putting the cap on it can help prevent. leaks all right we're gonna get to the. fun stuff and we're gonna try to fit all. of this into here I used to be a serious. over Packard. I remember going up these cobblestone. staircases in Italy lugging up my big. bag and my sister just looking at me. like she was embarrassed to be with me. from then I progressively learned how to. pack a little bit lighter I'm not gonna. say that I'm the best Packer in the. world but you know these are some tricks. that I've learned over the years. traveling a lot bring snacks very. important you don't want to be hangry. every trip is different so just plan. accordingly you might need to pack more. than this you might need to pack less. but I hope you found some of these tips. useful especially if you are an. over-packer. you.

Oh, would you look at that my fight departs in two hours I better start packing. Good thing i'm a minimalist. So this is personally how I pack as a minimalist. Let's start with the bag on this trip. I'll be using the packed one travel bag. I recently helped launch this product with a couple friends through an IndieGoGo campaign. It's really the perfect bag for minimalists people with OCD or serial killers. Okay, let's start packing. First I'll tuck my beard trimmer and razor in this pocket. I'm going away for a week, so let's grab five gray t-shirts. And you know what I might want to go out to a fancy dinner or something, so I'll bring a charcoal t-shirt as well. Okay, but seriously if I don't bring a button-up, Natalie is gonna kill me. Is it button-up or button-down?. I never really know... Bathing suit,. casual shorts, hiking shorts, going out in public shorts. and socks. Now I'm a filmmaker so nearly every vacation will include my camera, and usually my drone.. I'll talk the battery charger and batteries in the mesh pocket back here.. Zip this guy up.. My laptop goes in the center pocket.. I can hide the laundry bag behind this zip pocket.. I put my laptop charger in this mesh pocket here, and some additional cables and accessories for the drone,. A light jacket that I'll probably never wear.... After getting Salmonella on a trip over the holidays. I now always bring an extra pair of underwear, so let's bring eight. Alright, you know what let's just grab all these just in case. Man you know what I still have a lot of room in this thing. Why don't we bring along the framed poster for the award-winning documentary minimalism? my guitar.... another bag.... I'll pack my hiking sneakers fit the rest of my drone accessories in here,. And my headphones.. So that's all the inside contents of the bag. I'll put my iPad in the magazine pocket. Magnets will snap it shut and I'll place my passport safely inside this pocket inside a pocket. In these two pockets up front. I'll include hair product deodorant and a toothbrush. My keys I usually store my keys right in here. I'll pull out this little dope. Okay, you know. Done I was never meant to be a hand model. What's cool about this bag is if I pack right I can quickly access things like my camera. or my headphones. Or my laptop without digging through all the contents of my bag. And that is how I pack it. Can be really stressful packing especially when you're running late for your flight, but luckily since I'm a minimalist fuck that was two hours. Definitely missed my flight definitely missed my flight. If you like this video I make a lot of them subscribe to this channel for more or go to minimalist filemaker.com. if you like podcasts i've got one of those it's called the ground up show I. Interview people like Dan Harris rich roll and the minimalists to hear their stories. And how they made things happen go to ground-up show calm for the podcast. That's it.

===============================

The good news is that many major domestic US airlines have the same personal item size requirement of 18x14x8 inches. This includes American Airlines, Spirit, Frontier, and Allegiant.

The not so good news is that finding an underseat travel bag that measures 18x14x8 inches or under can be tough. Most wheeled luggage is too large, and many travel backpacks are carry-on size and would need to go into the overhead bin anyway. 

The stakes are even higher for Basic Economy passengers who are only allowed one personal item and run the risk of additional fees at the gate if the bag is too large to fit underneath the airplane seat.

This inspired us to make a video that not only showcases backpacks falling under the 18” x 14” x 8” personal item bag size limit but also are great for one-bag packing so that you can say goodbye to carry-on fees for good.

So, you need a personal item backpack for your next 
flight and it has to be small enough to fit underneath  . the airplane seat in front of you. But the carry-on 
bags you do own are way too large. And your trip  . is coming up fast. And you're breaking out the 
tape measure and trying not to panic. Listen, it's  . going to be okay! Because we already did all of the 
measuring for you with the bags in this video. The  . focus will be mostly on U.S domestic Airlines 
like Spirit, Frontier, Allegiant and American  . Airlines that have a personal item size limit of 
18 x 14 x 8 inches but there will be links in  . the video description to our buying guides for 
other airlines if you do need an even smaller  . personal item bag. We will be doing something 
called the t-shirt test for these backpacks,  . where we try to fit as many t-shirts as possible 
to give you an idea of how much each one can pack.  . So let's get right into it starting with the King 
Kong EDGE23. This is a compact backpack that  . opens like a suitcase making it a great option for 
one-bag travel on Basic Economy flights. You get 23  . liters of packing room and we found that it fits 
24 t-shirts inside the main packing compartment.  . What's great about this backpack is that it has 
these beefy compression straps to keep you under  . the airline personal item size limit even if you 
pack it full. Other awesome travel features include  . a laptop sleeve, big water bottle pockets, straps to 
attach it to wheeled luggage and a sealed pocket  . on the inside for shoes or dirty laundry. And 
trust us, this little feature makes all of the  . difference while traveling. If you want to travel 
with just their personal item another great  . bag is the Knack Pack Series 1 and we honestly 
can't recommend it enough. You get a hidden water  . bottle pocket, lockable zippers an external 13-inch 
laptop compartment and lots and lots of pockets  . for organization. What makes this bag special is 
that not only is it a daypack but it has a hidden  . travel compartment that expands for packing. Inside 
the packing compartment you can fit a total of 20  . t-shirts plus the main compartment fits another 
8 t-shirts giving you 28 t-shirts in total.  . Now, the Knack Pack Series 1 comes in different 
sizes and for a personal item bag we recommend  . going with the Small size to stay compliant. Next 
up we have the Timbuk2 Division laptop backpack,  . which has to be one of our favorite personal 
item backpacks for tech carry. Not only do you  . get a dedicated 15-inch laptop sleeve but there is 
another padded sleeve inside the main compartment  . for a second laptop or tablet. The division gives 
you 22 liters of packing room and we found that it  . can fit 22 t-shirts inside the main compartment. 
And it has lots of features that are great  . for travel like a water bottle pocket, a trolley 
sleeve to attach the bag to your carry-on luggage  . and compression straps on the side which 
really helps when packing. The shoulder  . straps and back panel are also super 
comfortable. I mean, just look at this  . padding! All in all the Timbuk2 Division is a 
great quality bag it is also small enough to  . use as a personal item on more restrictive 
airlines like JetBlue and United Airlines.  . If you want a more minimalist style we recommend 
the DB hugger 20 liter backpack. You get a roomy  . main compartment that opens nice and wide 
and it's lined with pockets for organization.  . And this backpack fits 19 t-shirts inside. We like 
the top compartment on this backpack because it  . makes it really easy to grab items when the bag 
is on the ground underneath the seat in front of  . you on the airplane. Plus, it has a rear laptop 
compartment so you don't disturb your packing  . when grabbing a laptop or tablet. If you want a 
bag that's high quality, lightweight, and easy to  . pack then the DB hugger is definitely the one to 
get. Plus, it comes in a ton of fun colors and who  . doesn't like that. Another great underseat bag is 
the Everyman Hideout 5-Way Commuter Pack. Not only  . can you wear it like a backpack but you can also 
carry it like a briefcase or like a messenger bag  . with the included strap. The Everyman Hideout 
Commuter gives you 18 liters of packing room  . and it even includes packing cubes and removable 
compression straps so everything you need for your  . next trip is included with the bag. We found that 
you can easily fit 20 t-shirts inside the packing  . compartment and the straps really help a lot with 
compressing everything down. There is also a second  . TSA compliant compartment that functions like a 
mobile office with a sleeve for your laptop and  . lots of pockets so that everything you need is 
right there in one spot. And one of the perks of  . the Everyman Hideout 5-Way Commuter is that 
you can tuck away all of the straps to take  . up less space underneath the airplane seat for 
neater experience on the plane. Next up we have  . the Everlane ReNew Transit backpack. This is one 
of the largest bags in terms of capacity at 27  . liters but it still surprisingly manages to stay 
under that 18 by 14 by 8 inch personal item size  . limit even when packed full. We found that the main 
compartment can fit 24 t-shirts making it a good  . option for short trips with a Basic Economy fare. 
Everlane did include some great travel features  . with this bag like a luggage strap, a separate sleeve
for easy access to a laptop or tablet. It also  . has a water bottle pocket on the outside of the 
bag and on the inside of the main compartment if  . you want something more discreet. If you're not 
a fan of this light color the ReNew Transit  . does come in darker colors, if you're worried 
about this bag getting dirty on those airplane  . floors. Sometimes they're sticky. So that's it 
for our personal item bag guide we have a ton  . more backpacks we have tested and do recommend 
that didn't make this video. You can always check  . out the links in the video description to check 
those out. If you're currently getting ready for  . your next trip, we hope you have a great one! 
And as always, thank you so much for watching.",6209,1156
