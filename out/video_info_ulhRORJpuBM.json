[Music]. a touch of fresh pepper how do we melt. that cheese properly first of all. turn off the heat get your lid. stick that on top. and that will help melt that cheese. beautifully. set that to the side. and now for the exciting part this is. where we start to build this beautiful. burger my buns are being toasted okay so. that's going to give me a little bit. more. crispiness on there as well first of all. a little smear. of mayonnaise. soft butter lettuce just don't slice it. just crack that open let that sit nicely. again layer it up a touch of salt touch. a pepper it goes a long way tomato one. i'm going to get a little touch of. mustard. a beautiful dijon mustard and just rub. that. on the top part of my bun and then from. there i need some acid. i've got my pickles now. we are ready. lid off look at that cheese. it's melted beautifully. you can still hear that cook taking. place inside the pan. that's going to sit on top. and then finally. these onions look at them. caramelized beautifully. i just love the flavor. i just like to hit that. with a touch. fresh pepper. and then. bang. now come on. that is a burger to die for",
