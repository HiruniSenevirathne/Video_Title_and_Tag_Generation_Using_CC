    "description": "Watch this quick video to learn the most compact packing techniques out there. Using the methods taught in this video will allow you to take more clothes with you on your trip, or, leave more space for souvenirs. \n\nI made a part two of this video as I've learned a few new methods since the first video and I also now use packing cubes and wouldn't be without them. Packing cubes really are a godsend when it comes to keeping things organised and quickly accessing whatever you want from your backpack. I hope this video gives you an idea of how much they can help. \n\nCheck out the bags and packing cubes featured in this video:\n\nFind the Cheapest flights and hotels with Skyscanner:\nhttps://skyscanner.pxf.io/c/3591705/1027991/13416?associateid=AFF_TRA_19354_00001\n\nBAGS \nhttps://www.tombihn.com/products/aeronaut-45?ref=5a58ce420a926\n\nPacking Cubes \nhttps://www.tombihn.com/collections/accessories/products/packing-cube-aeronaut-45?ref=5a58ce420a926\n\n\nI've personally used the same bags as the ones featured in the video for years now and I couldn't recommend them highly enough. \n\nWatch part one here to see a few additional methods not shown in this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QyYgZ6Lrqg&t=49s\n\nMy Gear:\nAmazing camera bag http://amzn.to/2px813d\nCamera: http://amzn.to/2IL8vKQ\nSecondary/slow mo camera http://amzn.to/2G3MSDS\nMy main lens: http://amzn.to/2ujK1FF\nAmazing Bokeh lens http://amzn.to/2IFpJt3\nThe macro lens I love: http://amzn.to/2ILmSia\nMy mic: http://amzn.to/2pxQ1Vm\nMain tripod http://amzn.to/2IFqIcJ\nThe tripod I use for some macros and funny angels http://amzn.to/2IJpP2M\nVariable ND filter https://amzn.to/2N1j41v\nMy slider http://amzn.to/2Gcxvwe\n\nI do receive a small commission if you make a purchase through any of the links above :)",
