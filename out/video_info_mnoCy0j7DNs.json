Organization report reminds us that. there are 1,900 arable insect species. out there that some 2 billion Earthlings. already regularly consume beetles. butterflies moths bees and locusts. insects are abundantly available and. rich in low-fat protein fiber and. minerals lab meat scientists came up. with synthetic meat grown in the lab as. early as 2013 scientists have already. cultured ground beef from cows stem. cells although that lab patty cost three. hundred and thirty thousand dollars to. make and tasted quite bland. experts predict it will only take a. decade or two for an affordable product. that looks cooks smells and tastes like. ground beef algae while it is already. used as a biofuel algae is seen as a. solution for the problem of food. shortages as it can feed humans and. animals alike algae is the fastest. growing plant on earth and has long been. cultivated in Asia food experts predicts. algae farming could become the world's. biggest crop industry as it can be grown. in both the oceans and in freshwater it. is a good source of vitamins and. minerals. farmed fish 3.5 billion humans today. depend on the oceans for their primary. food source that figure will double in. 20 years. fortunately humans are aware of this and. have implemented sustainable commercial. fishing practices and turned to. cultivating fish aquaculture is going. big with 35 countries producing more. farmed fish than fish caught in the wild. a milestone was reached in 2011 when for. the first time more fish were farmed. than beef a trend that has continued GMO.

DNA of plants in the 80s to make them. disease resistant by the nineties GM. foods were commercially available. several food items we consume fruits. crops livestock's even fish have. undergone some sort of genetic. modification these are generally safe. and went through strict standards 3d. printed dishes straight from the printer. and onto the plate you will be able to. fully customize food shapes textures. tastes and forms you can order online. your favorite chocolate bar or snack and. 3d princes with a machine at home the. food you're craving will just be a print. away.
