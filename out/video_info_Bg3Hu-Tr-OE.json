Vaseline or baby oil they kept them soft. you don't really need too much and it. also depends on how soft you want just. massage it into there. watch the magic happen right in front of. your eyes too many dust particles other. colored clay or fingerprints on your. piece don't worry about it. use rubbing alcohol and a q-tip to clean. it up equally you can use nail polish. remover or baby wipes. nail polish remover also works after the. clay is baked so you have plenty of. options don't like paying high prices. for small bottles of glaze make your way. to the hardware store more often than. not you'll find for practically the same. price you can get wood varnish that is. safe for polymer clay and you're getting. a lot more just make sure that it is. water-based as you can see it gives a. wonderfully glossy finish to pieces I. hope you guys enjoyed these hacks I had. a lot of fun putting them together don't. forget to leave a like share and. subscribe if you're new to this channel. if you have suggestions for future geeky. tutorials leave them in the comments. section below until then I will see you. guys next time",
