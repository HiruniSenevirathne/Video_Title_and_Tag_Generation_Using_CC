International Space Station tonight we. thought we would show you a little bit. about some meal prep what we do for. meals on board the space station so the. answer is we have a great variety of two. different general types of food thermo. stabilized food and these green packets. that's very similar to military MREs or. meals ready to eat and then we also have. freeze-dried food put it here inside the. food warmer and then we have. refrigerated space here they've been. nice enough to allow us to use these. just for food all right dinner table. some Turkish fish stew butternut squash. all right I'm having rice with butter. some lentil soup and grilled chicken. patty a lot of the Russian food comes in. cans this is one of my favorites this is. spicy beef and rice. basically eating a lot more fun you can. turn your spoon upside down where you to. let it go and nothing's gonna fall off.
