But people have a hard time agreeing on exactly how AI will affect our society. Can we build AI systems that help us fix the world? Or are we doomed to a robotic takeover?

    "captions": ". In the coming years, \nartificial intelligence. is probably going to change your life, \nand likely the entire world.. But people have a hard time\nagreeing on exactly how.. The following are excerpts \nfrom a World Economic Forum interview. where renowned computer science professor \nand AI expert Stuart Russell. helps separate the sense \nfrom the nonsense.. There\u2019s a big difference between asking\na human to do something. and giving that as the objective\nto an AI system.. When you ask a human to get\nyou a cup of coffee,. you don\u2019t mean this should be \ntheir life\u2019s mission,. and nothing else in the universe matters.. Even if they have to kill everybody else\nin Starbucks. to get you the coffee before it closes\u2014\nthey should do that.. No, that\u2019s not what you mean.. All the other things that\nwe mutually care about,. they should factor\ninto your behavior as well.. And the problem with the way \nwe build AI systems now. is we give them a fixed objective.. The algorithms require us\nto specify everything in the objective.. And if you say, can we fix the\nacidification of the oceans?. Yeah, you could have a catalytic reaction\nthat does that extremely efficiently,. but it consumes a quarter \nof the oxygen in the atmosphere,. which would apparently cause us to die\nfairly slowly and unpleasantly. over the course of several hours.. So, how do we avoid this problem?. You might say, okay, well, just be more\ncareful about specifying the objective\u2014. don\u2019t forget the atmospheric oxygen.. And then, of course, some side effect\nof the reaction in the ocean. poisons all the fish.. Okay, well I meant don\u2019t kill\nthe fish either.. And then, well, what about\nthe seaweed?. Don\u2019t do anything that\u2019s going\nto cause all the seaweed to die.. And on and on and on.. And the reason that we don\u2019t have to do\nthat with humans is that. humans often know that they don\u2019t know \nall the things that we care about.. If you ask a human to get you\na cup of coffee,. and you happen to be \nin the Hotel George Sand in Paris,. where the coffee is 13 euros a cup,. it\u2019s entirely reasonable to come\nback and say, well, it\u2019s 13 euros,. are you sure you want it, \nor I could go next door and get one?. And it\u2019s a perfectly normal thing\nfor a person to do.. To ask, I\u2019m going to repaint your house\u2014. is it okay if I take off the drainpipes\nand then put them back?. We don't think of this as a terribly\nsophisticated capability,. but AI systems don\u2019t have it \nbecause the way we build them now,. they have to know the full objective.. If we build systems that know that \nthey don\u2019t know what the objective is,. then they start to exhibit\nthese behaviors,. like asking permission before getting rid\nof all the oxygen in the atmosphere.. In all these senses, \ncontrol over the AI system. comes from the machine\u2019s uncertainty \nabout what the true objective is.. And it\u2019s when you build machines that\nbelieve with certainty. that they have the objective,. that\u2019s when you get this\nsort of psychopathic behavior.. And I think we see \nthe same thing in humans.. What happens when general purpose AI\nhits the real economy?. How do things change? Can we adapt?. This is a very old point.. Amazingly, Aristotle actually has\na passage where he says,. look, if we had fully automated \nweaving machines. and plectrums that could pluck the lyre \nand produce music without any humans,. then we wouldn\u2019t need any workers.. That idea, which I think it was Keynes. who called it technological unemployment \nin 1930,. is very obvious to people.. They think, yeah, of course, \nif the machine does the work,. then I'm going to be unemployed.. You can think about the warehouses \nthat companies are currently operating. for e-commerce, \nthey are half automated.. The way it works is that an old warehouse\u2014\nwhere you\u2019ve got tons of stuff piled up. all over the place \nand humans go and rummage around. and then bring it back and send it off\u2014. there\u2019s a robot who goes\nand gets the shelving unit. that contains the thing that you need,. but the human has to pick the object \nout of the bin or off the shelf,. because that\u2019s still too difficult.. But, at the same time,. would you make a robot that is accurate\nenough to be able to pick. pretty much any object within a very wide \nvariety of objects that you can buy?. That would, at a stroke, \neliminate 3 or 4 million jobs?. There's an interesting story\nthat E.M. Forster wrote,. where everyone is entirely\nmachine dependent.. The story is really about the\nfact that if you hand over. the management of your civilization\nto machines,. you then lose the incentive to understand\nit yourself. or to teach the next generation \nhow to understand it.. You can see \u201cWALL-E\u201d\nactually as a modern version,. where everyone is enfeebled\nand infantilized by the machine,. and that hasn\u2019t been possible\nup to now.. We put a lot of our civilization \ninto books,. but the books can\u2019t run it for us.. And so we always have to teach\nthe next generation.. If you work it out, it\u2019s about a trillion\nperson years of teaching and learning. and an unbroken chain that goes back \ntens of thousands of generations.. What happens if that chain breaks?. I think that\u2019s something we have \nto understand as AI moves forward.. The actual date of arrival\nof general purpose AI\u2014. you\u2019re not going to be able to pinpoint,\nit isn\u2019t a single day.. It\u2019s also not the case \nthat it\u2019s all or nothing.. The impact is going to be increasing.. So with every advance in AI,. it significantly expands\nthe range of tasks.. So in that sense, I think most experts say\nby the end of the century,. we\u2019re very, very likely to have \ngeneral purpose AI.. The median is something around 2045.. I'm a little more on the\nconservative side.. I think the problem is\nharder than we think.. I like what John McAfee, \nhe was one of the founders of AI,. when he was asked this question, he said, \nsomewhere between five and 500 years.. And we're going to need, I think, several\nEinsteins to make it happen.",
