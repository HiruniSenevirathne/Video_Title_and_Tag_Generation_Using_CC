    "captions": ". The fact that we humans who are ourselves mere\u00a0\ncollections of fundamental particles of nature\u00a0\u00a0. have been able to come this close to an\u00a0\nunderstanding of the laws governing us\u00a0\u00a0. and our Universe. It's a great triumph.\u00a0\u00a0. What we're looking for is how everything works?\u00a0\nand how everything... what makes everything work?. Things that make the Wind make the Waves. And\u00a0\nthe Motion of Water is like the Motion of Air is\u00a0\u00a0. like the Motion of Sand. The fact that things have\u00a0\ncommon features turns out more and more universal.\u00a0\u00a0. But it's a curiosity as to where we are? What\u00a0\nwe are? What's the pleasure in Physics is\u00a0\u00a0. that to me is that as it's revealed that\u00a0\nthe truth is so remarkable, so amazing.\u00a0. You asked me if an ordinary person by\u00a0\nstudying hard would get to be able to\u00a0\u00a0. imagine these things like i imagine.\nOf course! I was an ordinary person\u00a0. who studied hard. There's no miracle people. It\u00a0\njust happens. They got interested in this thing\u00a0\u00a0. and they learned all this stuff.. We choose to go to the moon in this\u00a0\ndecade and do the other things.\u00a0\u00a0. Not because they are easy\u00a0\nbut because they are hard.. When you're thinking about something you\u00a0\ndon't understand, you have a terrible\u00a0\u00a0. uncomfortable feeling called confusion.. It's a very difficult and unhappy business.. Saying that you don't understand it meaning\nI don't believe it. It's too crazy.\u00a0. It's the kind of thing I\u00a0\njust I'm not going to accept.\u00a0. So remember to look up at the\u00a0\nstarts and not down at your feet.\u00a0. Try to make sense of what you see and\u00a0\nwonder about what makes the Universe exist.\u00a0. I find myself trying to imagine all kinds of\u00a0\nthings all the time and I get a kick out of it.\u00a0. Just like a runner gets a kick out of sweating.. I get a kick out of thinking.",
